# jonnyboris.github.io

A really simple in browser text editor. 
I built this so that I could have an easily accessible place to take down a few notes, hopefully it can help you too (Keep it in your bookmarks bar!).

However be careful, it's set up to save what ever you type into localstorage, and will hang/kill the browser with large bits of text.
